# TodoApi20
Tasks to do


# For each item, add buttons ”up” and ”down”
When “up” is pressed, the item should move one row up in the table (if not already at the top)
The new position should be stored in the database

 
# Add a global checkbox that will toggle the visibility of completed items
Completed items should be hidden by default, and visible if the checkbox is checked

 
# When an item is completed it should move below the last not completed item
If a completed item is edited to be “uncompleted” it should move to be the last of the not completed items

# Add a date column showing the time (hh:mm:ss) when the item was created
